## Summary
First tagged release of AITaxAgentW2 with local-first RAG Q&A, W-2 validation, demo workflow, CI tests, and release/distribution documentation.

## Notable Changes
- Implemented local document ingestion (`w2 ingest`) with LangChain + Chroma + Ollama embeddings
- Implemented grounded Q&A (`w2 ask`) with citations, confidence reporting, and insufficient-context handling
- Implemented W-2 validation (`w2 validate`) with parsing + warning-oriented checks
- Improved extraction robustness for difficult PDF text layouts
- Added optional OCR fallback path for low-quality/scanned W-2 PDFs
- Added unit tests and CI pytest integration
- Added end-to-end demo script and walkthrough docs
- Added onboarding install/run docs, troubleshooting, and release playbook

## Install / Upgrade Notes
- Python 3.11+
- Ollama required
- Pull local models:
  - `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
  - `ollama pull llama3.2`

## Validation
- `ruff check src tests`
- `pytest -q`
- `./scripts/demo.sh`

## Known Limitations
- Some scanned or substitute W-2 layouts may still need improved OCR/table extraction tuning.
- OCR fallback requires optional dependencies and native Tesseract setup.

## Security
- Sensitive W-2 files are expected to remain local and untracked.
- `W2s(Confidential)/` is gitignored.

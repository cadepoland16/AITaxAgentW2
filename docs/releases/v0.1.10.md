## Summary
Patch release adding a W-2 checklist command for practical filing prep workflow.

## Notable Changes
- Added `w2 checklist` command to generate:
  - detected signals from parsed W-2 values
  - action items for review before filing
  - follow-up questions to resolve missing/ambiguous fields
- Added deterministic checklist builder in validation layer
- Added tests for checklist logic and CLI output sections

## Install / Upgrade Notes
- Existing setup remains valid.
- Pull models if needed:
  - `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
  - `ollama pull llama3.2`

## Validation
- `ruff check src tests`
- `pytest -q`

## Known Limitations

## Security
- Sensitive W-2 files remain local and untracked.

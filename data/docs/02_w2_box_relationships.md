# W-2 Box Relationships (Demo)

Common relationships to explain:

- Box 1 may be lower than Box 3/5 if pre-tax deductions reduce federal taxable wages.
- Box 3 is subject to the annual Social Security wage limit.
- Box 5 often differs from Box 1 because some deductions affect federal but not Medicare wages.
- Box 2 should generally be non-negative and often rises with wage amount, but exact withholding varies by W-4 and payroll timing.

If values look unusual, validate against pay stubs and employer payroll records.

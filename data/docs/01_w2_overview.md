# W-2 Overview (Demo)

Form W-2 reports employee compensation and withholding.

Key ideas:
- Box 1 (Wages, tips, other compensation) is federal taxable wages.
- Box 2 is federal income tax withheld.
- Box 3 and Box 5 are Social Security and Medicare wage bases.
- Box 12 includes coded items such as retirement or health coverage reporting.
- State and local wages/withholding appear in later boxes.

A practical review compares related boxes for obvious inconsistencies before filing.
